title: "Computational Geometry"
---

Intro
--
Sometimes, you can get insights just from the keywords associated with a problem. Here, I intend to list the problems I have encountered while studying computational geometry. The sources of the problems are described as:  

* __handcrafted by myself__: No special explanation is provided.
* __famous theorem or problem__: Formatted like *(famous theorem name)*.
* __found from a specific source__: References are provided within the explanation.
