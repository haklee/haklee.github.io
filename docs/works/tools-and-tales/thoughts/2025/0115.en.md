In December 2024, Autodesk announced that they would be [archiving forum posts over 10 years old](https://forums.autodesk.com/t5/community-announcements/community-content-archiving-announcement-and-faq/td-p/13187702) across all their products. This decision isn't entirely unreasonable, considering that Autodesk products are continuously updated, meaning older posts might contain outdated information, and the vast amount of accumulated records likely incurred significant service operation costs. However, as someone who has relied heavily on various forum posts for AutoCAD plugin development, the sudden disappearance of these valuable tips is quite disconcerting.

As mentioned in a [previous post](../2024/0707.md), AutoCAD's .NET forum had been active since the early 2000s. The fact that many of the threads I referenced during development were written in 2006 and 2008 shows that these older posts remained valid for a considerable period. When searching for specific functionality or reasons for certain errors, official documentation rarely appeared in the results. This alone demonstrates that the AutoCAD development ecosystem was maintained through people sharing working code after trial and error, compensating for inadequate official documentation. With these tips suddenly disappearing, it's clear that this ecosystem will regress and shrink. Many of the comments I left while developing plugins included references to forum posts, but now these links redirect to the forum's main page instead of the original content. We will no longer be able to understand why certain code was written in a particular style, or what alternatives existed and their respective pros and cons.

While official documentation might improve in the future (perhaps with AI integration), and the forum might be revitalized with new valuable resources, both will likely take time. Until such resources are prepared, I'll need to review my existing code to recall specific implementation techniques. I'm planning to gradually organize these details before too much time passes and I forget the implementation specifics.
