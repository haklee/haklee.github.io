At the time of writing this post, Autodesk provides a tutorial for developing basic AutoCAD plugins through [this link](https://www.autodesk.com/support/technical/article/caas/tsarticles/ts/6kRFCS0mCalWLwAOpP9pNT.html). However, this tutorial is somewhat difficult to follow for the following reasons:

- The tutorial is written based on `Visual Basic .NET`. Nowadays, `C#` is much more popular.
- The method for installing debugging tools is not explained in detail.
- There are broken image links from the very first page. Could this mean the tutorial is not being well maintained?

Therefore, I plan to write a new tutorial that improves upon these elements to make it easier for beginners to follow. Specifically, I will explain the following processes:

- Setting up the development environment: Installing Visual Studio Community and AutoCAD .NET Wizard
- Creating the first project
- Generating DLL file through project building and loading DLL file in CAD
- Debugging

The following topics will not be covered in this tutorial and will be explained separately in other topics later:

- Plugin feature development through code writing
- Version control using git
