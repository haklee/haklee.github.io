title: "Tools and Tales"
---

For an idea not to end up as just an idea, it must be implemented in some way. It is only after going through the trial and error that you can discern whether the idea was merely a fantasy, or a blueprint of a brilliant masterpiece. Some ideas required mastering various tools in order to implement them, so I spent sufficient time studying the tools. As my understanding of the tools deepened, new ideas arose in my mind- so I conducted some experiments with the tools to test the idea, or created small problems or challenges to capture the essence of the findings.

The more proficient I became with the tools, the more I could make. Some tools could be interconnected to implement larger ideas. Certain ideas could be implemented through different sets of tools, and the resulting outputs sometimes exhibited the same performance, and sometimes possessed unique details due to the tools involved in their creation.

In this topic, I will briefly explain the various tools I have encountered so far, discuss what I have made through these tools, and share the thoughts I had while working with them.

The best way to become familiar with tools is to create something directly using the tools. In this section, I introduce forms created by tools-mainly using grasshopper. Some forms could exist only within the screen, while others were designed to be fabricated using physical materials.

If tools are devices used to create something, then from the perspective of tools, data structures and algorithms can be considered the language that forms the basis of this 'something'. In this section, I discuss how to define the architectural spaces and forms through programming languages, what operations are possible, and what theoretical foundations these operations are based on.

Some ideas can be implemented more intuitively through specific tools. In this section I will cover what can be done using specific tools.

In this section, I freely record thoughts about tools.
