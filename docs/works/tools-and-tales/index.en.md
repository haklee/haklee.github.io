For an idea not to end up as just an idea, it must be implemented in some way. It is only after going through the trial and error that you can discern whether the idea was merely a fantasy, or a blueprint of a brilliant masterpiece. Some ideas required mastering various tools in order to implement them, so I spent sufficient time studying the tools. As my understanding of the tools deepened, new ideas arose in my mind- so I conducted some experiments with the tools to test the idea, or created small problems or challenges to capture the essence of the findings.

The more proficient I became with the tools, the more I could make. Some tools could be interconnected to implement larger ideas. Certain ideas could be implemented through different sets of tools, and the resulting outputs sometimes exhibited the same performance, and sometimes possessed unique details due to the tools involved in their creation.

In this topic, I will briefly explain the various tools I have encountered so far, discuss what I have made through these tools, and share the thoughts I had while working with them.
