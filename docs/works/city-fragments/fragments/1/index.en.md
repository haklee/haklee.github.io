City can no longer be described solely by buildings and streets, stories passed from mouth to mouth among its members, tangible, visible, audible things that physically exist. Instead, the city is full of shops which suddenly appear and disappear, people suddenly gathering at an unknown events, and anonymous travelers enjoying the planned trips to places where no acquaintance lives. The physical city transforms into formless information, and people gather where information accumulates.

If the storage and flow of information draws people together, can the spaces created in this way also be considered part of the city? The city's members access countless websites and games. Although these spaces may follow different rules from physical cities, they extend the city in that interactions can occur between people and people, or between people and the elements that make up the space, and in that some kind of experience can take place during the time spent in that space. Then, can we say that the city we live in is composed of a connection of urban fragments formed by different rules?

The city we are walking through has as many other layers as there are new spaces where city information is gathered. Or, among the cities we scroll through with our eyes, some cities actually have a space that can be walked through.
