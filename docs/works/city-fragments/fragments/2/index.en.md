## City, Afterimages

*Excerpted from notes written on 2019-08-24*

Is 010-1234-5678 John Doe really John Doe? Even after the number's owner changes, some will still look for John Doe, some will look for John Doe with his new number, and some will look for someone else using John Doe's old number. While some information in the city, like physical location, is updated in real-time, other information may update slowly or not at all. There's information that remains like an afterimage and gradually fades, information that stays in place until overwritten by new data, information that degrades each time when it's partially copied and moved elsewhere...
Just as a street without cleaners accumulates the city's wastes, information piles up everywhere and flows into unexpected places. Without realizing it, I'm already flowing through various parts of the city.

## Friend, Transformation

*Written on 2024-07-23*

Two friends whom I had registered by phone number in my messenger app have changed their nicknames to "Flower" and "Cargo Man," but I have no idea when this happened.

## Things, Existence

*Excerpted from notes written on 2019-04-03*

Is a branch still alive if it remains locally even though it has been deleted remotely?

## City Expansion, Log

*Excerpted from notes written on 2019-03-06*

```
...
// I'm leaving this record for those who have reached this point while expanding the city. 
// The closed area beyond this point was created by the original city developers.
// After the second residential area expansion update, much of it became incompatible with the newly applied regulations, so it's not in use.
// However, some crucial structural elements that must be referenced have been maintained until now.
// Please review it, remove unnecessary parts, and update this notice.

## Experience, Uniqueness

*Excerpted from notes written on 2019-05-03*

Let's imagine a city populated by people who have no bodies, so they don't collide with each other, but they have eyes, so they can see their surroundings (of course, their eyes don't collide either). In such a city, multiple people can exist in one place simultaneously. This means that, unlike in a normal situation where only one person occupying that physical space with their body could see that exact place at that time and location, this city is different.
Can we say that visual experiences in this city are unique? If so, what would be the basis for this uniqueness? In the world we live in, what value does the uniqueness of visual experience hold, and how are these values utilized? Does the aforementioned value hold the same context of value in the imagined world?
