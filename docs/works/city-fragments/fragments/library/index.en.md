*Excerpted from a conversation on 2024-08-10*

**Hak Lee(H)**: What do you think about libraries?

**Claude 3.5 Sonnet(C)**: I think libraries are important spaces for knowledge and learning. They provide free access to books and information, offering educational opportunities to everyone. They also support personal growth through quiet study environments and diverse resources. Libraries also serve as community centers, connecting people through cultural events and programs.

Is there anything specific you'd like to know more about regarding libraries? For example, I could explain more about the history of libraries or how the role of modern libraries is changing.

**H**: Then, can there be a library without books? Or a library without people?

**C**: Interesting questions. Let's look at each of these cases:

1. A library without books:
    
    With modern technological advancements, the concept of a 'bookless library' is becoming a reality. Such libraries could take forms like:
    
    * Digital libraries: All materials are provided as e-books, audiobooks, or digital documents.
    * Multimedia centers: Information is accessed through computers, tablets, and other digital devices instead of books.
    * Makerspaces: Spaces that provide practical tools like 3D printers, robotics kits, etc.
    
    These spaces may not have traditional books, but they still fulfill the essential functions of a library: learning and information sharing.

2. A library without people:
    
    This concept also exists in reality:
    
    * Unmanned libraries: Operating 24/7 through automated systems, allowing check-out/return without librarians.
    * Online libraries: Libraries that exist only online without a physical space.
    * Robot librarians: Some libraries use robots for tasks like book sorting or guiding.
    
    However, a completely 'people-less' library is realistically difficult. Human roles are still important for system management, material selection, answering complex queries, etc.

These new forms of libraries are expanding the traditional concept of a library. However, they still maintain the core values of libraries: providing access to information and sharing knowledge. What do you think about this?

**H**: Let me change the question. Not a library without people to operate and manage it, but can there be a library in a world where there are no people to read books?

**C**: Ah, I see. That's a very profound question. Let's consider the possibility of a library existing in a world where there's no one to read books.

1. Meaning of existence:
The fundamental purpose of a library is to preserve and disseminate knowledge. If there's no one to consume that knowledge, the reason for the library's existence disappears. This is similar to the philosophical question, "If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?"

2. Physical existence:
Physically, the library building and books could remain. However, a library that's not maintained without users would eventually collapse or return to nature over time.

3. Preservation for the future:
Even if there's no one to read books at the moment, libraries might be maintained to preserve knowledge for future generations or other civilizations. This is similar to how we currently preserve records of ancient civilizations.

4. AI and robots:
We could imagine a scenario where humans don't read books, but AI or robots use libraries to process and learn information.

5. Symbolic meaning:
Even if there's no one to read books, libraries could be preserved as symbols of knowledge and culture that once existed.

In conclusion, the existence of a library in a world where there's no one to read books is very questionable, as the core function of the library would be gone. However, there's a possibility it could be maintained for specific purposes (future preservation, AI use, etc.) or symbolic meaning. This ultimately depends on how we define a 'library'.

This hypothetical situation makes us think deeply about the value of knowledge and culture, and the essence of human civilization. What do you think about this?
