>I wonder what the users, who gathered at the starting village plaza one last time, felt, when they watched the message on the screen "[Connection to the server has been lost]" while chatting with their party members whom they used to raid with. What feelings did the planners and developers who watched that final scene while checking the server time have? When explaining work to new team member, using the no-longer-serviced game as an example, I saw a change in their eyes. I couldn't bring myself to say that I have the opening song saved on all my devices and I listen to it some time.

Were the fields I wandered searching for materials for daily quests and the ancient ruins where I raided with my party, merely existing within the screen? When my battle mage got hurt in the quarter view screen, was I really just sitting in front of the screen unfazed? I remember wandaring around a peculiar world where I moved backward when I tried to move forward wearing my special equipments with slow-down effect, and where only half of my friend's character arrive after teleporting when I tried to enter the dungeon with my friend simultaneously.
