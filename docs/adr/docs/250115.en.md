# Sort the "Thoughts" and "ADR" posts in descending order by date

## Context and Problem Statement

Posts in the "Thoughts" and "ADR" category are currently sorted by date in ascending order, making it difficult to check newly added posts.

## Decision Drivers

* Want to make it easier to see newly added posts.

## Considered Options

* Maintain current date-based ascending sort order
* Change to date-based descending sort order

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Change to date-based descending sort order", because

* It makes it easier to see newly added posts.
* While it becomes slightly harder to access older posts, I determined that having newer posts appear first is more important.
