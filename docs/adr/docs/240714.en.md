# Logging TIL

## Context and Problem Statement

It would be good to organize somewhere the information I've found while working with various tools, so I can easily look it up later. Currently, I'm not managing a separate TIL (Today I Learned), but I think it's a good idea to manage such an item on the site.

## Decision Drivers

* I hope it would be easy to log consistently. In other words, I'd like the log management to be simple.
* TIL docs doesn't need to be well-organized, and while it would be nice if it's searchable, it's okay if it's not.


## Considered Options

* Manage TIL by creating a new tab in the same way as ADR
* Manage by creating an item within the `works/tools and tales` category


## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Manage by creating an item within the `works/tools and tales` category", because

* It doesn't seem to be a big enough topic to publish as a new tab, and adding tabs like this might make the site too cluttered.
* Since it's recording the content of studying tools, it's natural for it to be a sub-item of such category.
* It seems fine to view the study process itself as a work.
