# Whether to use the sponsored version of MkDocs Material

## Context and Problem Statement

MkDocs Material provides very useful features for site generation, but some features are only available if you [sponsor the project creator](https://github.com/sponsors/squidfunk).

## Decision Drivers

* I would like to minimize the effort required to create the site.
* I would also like to minimize the cost involved.


## Considered Options

* Use the insider features through a $15 monthly 'The Individual' sponsorship
* Use only the basic features, excluding the insider features


## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "Use only the basic features, excluding the insider features", because

* The basic features provided seemed sufficient.
* I decided that if the insider features become absolutely necessary, it would be fine to switch the decision later.
